        <h2> Work History</h2>

        <h3>Freelance Web Developer</h3>
       <p>
         I have been working as a freelance web developer since the end of 2020. I am very passionate about entrepreneurship and found that web development gives a me great chance to get paid for something I love doing!
       </p>
        <h3>Life's a Journey Counseling Services LLC.</h3>
       <p>
         This was a counseling agency that I worked for as an assistant. I helped the owner in a multitude of ways; whether that was scheduling appointments, transcribing notes, filing, or entering in billing information.  
       </p>
        <h3>Jensen Jewelers</h3>
        <p>
          This was my first job, which gave me my knowledge in sales and customer service. Ultimately, I had to leave due to the lack of flexibility in their schedule (I was still a full-time student and athlete at the time).        </p>
